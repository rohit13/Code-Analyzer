Instructions for running the project.

1. Use compile.bat to comiple the project.
2. Use run.bat to run the project.
There are two arguments provided in the run.bat run command.


Argument 1 : Directory
Argument 2 : Pattern

Argument 2 is comma separated. So, if you want to give multiple extension give them as comma separated string.

For Req 10:
As stated in the requirement, I have tested my code for all the *cpp and *.h files in all the packages of the project.
If you want to test for a smaller subset. There are test files in 'Inputs' folder. Please change the folder name in run.bat script before testing that particular folder.

Note:
I have provided a key stroke required method to proceed ahead on console after each file. This is to enable better analysis in case the output is too long.
